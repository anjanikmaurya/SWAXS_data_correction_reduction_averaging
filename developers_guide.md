# Developers Guide

## Notes
1. If the periodic table library doesn't support a compound, then you may need to change the code
2. If you add another attribute to correction_integration_demo.py, make sure to also add it to the type hints at the top.
3. If metadata has a string type that's not convertible to an integer, files_averaging may have issues averaging metadata
