# SWAXS_data_reduction_correction_Analysis

This is a user-guide to use this repository, with detailed steps about how to use it. For a developer-guide, with details about adding code, use developer_guide.md

## 1. Set up code
First, clone this repository on the directory where you want to use it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vsomani-slac/SWAXS_data_reduction_correction_Analysis
```
Then, it is highly recommended to create a virtual environment for this project and activate it. You can use a different package manager if you would like. This is the workflow of creating a pip venv virtual environment called .venv in this directory:
```bash
python -m venv .venv  
source .venv/bin/activate
```
If it went correctly, you should now see the (.venv) on your terminal. Next, within your virtual environment itself (if you created one), perform this pip install command.
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## 2. Run demo example

(Will add a demo example which should be configured. It can double up as a test-case to make sure that the core functionality is still working properly. 
Include the steps of starting with the right directory structure).
